# Changelog

## 1.4.0

First experience and milestones. The engine is untouched in this release — the
adaptive core is identical to 1.3.0, bit for bit.

### First run

- **Onboarding.** Three cards on a fresh install, explaining the one thing the
  UI cannot show by itself: the plan moves because you answer, and the first
  workout is deliberately easy because it is a starting point, not a test.
  Skipping counts as seen.
- **"How it works"** — the first row in Settings. Six sections covering the
  level, what a rating does, deload, rotation, skips, and why there are no
  questionnaires. Every number in it matches the engine rather than rounding
  for the story.

### Milestones

- A workout that unlocks a harder variation, crosses into another set band, or
  lands on the 10th, 25th or every 50th session ends on one screen listing what
  it earned. Tier-ups above the jubilee, no confetti, no badges.
- Only upward movement is announced. A deload or a shortfall is never
  commented on.
- **Share card** — rendered on device at 1080×1350 and passed to the system
  share sheet: a milestone line, a date, the wordmark. No body metrics, no
  streak, no network. Also available from Progress as a totals card.

### Asking for a review

- One automatic trigger: closing a milestone screen, and only after five
  workouts, never following a session rated harder than planned, and at most
  once every sixty days. Settings gains an About section so a review can always
  be left on purpose instead.

### Accessibility

- Every screen honours Dynamic Type. The few display numbers that are already
  enormous by design scale to a cap rather than pushing the screen out from
  under themselves; the rest timer's ring grows with the countdown it frames.
- VoiceOver labels on the controls that were reading as bare symbol names, and
  decorative icons hidden from the rotor.

### Fixes

- A rest day showed a live plan with a Start button on Today while the widget
  said "Rest day" and the next-workout date skipped the day — three answers to
  one question. Today now agrees with both, and keeps a "Train anyway" escape
  hatch, because a rest day is the user's own setting.
- Rest days in the calendar carried no mark and read like days outside the
  month. They now have a soft fill and a legend entry.

## 1.3.0

Two development waves ship together: the engine work originally staged as 1.2.0 (which was never released) and the progress-and-integrations wave.

### Engine — v2.2

- **Level ceiling raised from 31 to 47.** Above tier 4 progression continues by adding a set instead of a variation: 3 sets up to level 31, 4 sets for 32–39, 5 sets for 40–47. The top of the system is now 5 × 15 rather than a dead end at 4 × 15.
- **Pull-up bar module.** An optional vertical-pull branch — bar hang, negative pull-up, partial pull-up, pull-up — with its own independent level. With the bar enabled, every other session swaps the floor pull for a vertical one. Turning it off freezes the branch without losing progress.
- Library grew from 36 to 40 exercises (10 patterns × 4 tiers), each with technique steps and common mistakes in both languages.
- Reference verification: 3,223 property checks, 0 failures. Golden fixtures: 7 scenarios, 113 steps, reproduced bit-for-bit by the Swift port.

### Progress and history

- **Level chart** across sessions (Swift Charts), with per-pattern projections and an "All" total view.
- **Weekly summary** — workouts and level delta for the current ISO week. A deload week honestly shows a minus.
- Per-pattern level bars, including the vertical-pull branch once it exists.

### System integrations

- **Apple Health** — write-only export of completed workouts as functional strength training. Nothing is ever read. Existing history can be backfilled; a high-water mark makes export idempotent, so a repeated backfill never creates duplicates.
- **Live Activity** — the rest countdown on the lock screen and in the Dynamic Island, ending automatically when the workout does.
- **Home-screen widget** — today's status at a glance (workout / done / rest day), flipping at midnight without the app running.

### Fixes

- Health export no longer advances its high-water mark on a failed save, so a failed workout stays retriable instead of being silently lost.
- Backfill stops at the first failure rather than marking the whole tail exported.
- Live Activity no longer races itself when a second workout starts right after the first.
- Progress chips and chart outlines use `strokeBorder`, so the outline is no longer clipped.
- The backup snapshot rebuilds when settings change while the sheet is open.
- Technique is reachable from the rest screen, not only from the plan.
- Russian strings normalized to use `е` rather than `ё` throughout.
- The widget extension's bundle version was stuck at 1.1 (build 2) while the app moved on; all four targets now ship the same version, which App Store validation requires.

### Documentation

- README rewritten to match the shipped product — it had been describing v1.0 (level range 0–31, 36 exercises, 4 golden scenarios). Two claims that were never true were also removed: the exercise library is hand-written rather than generated from a bilingual table, and the calendar does not mark rest days.
- TESTPLAN.md added: a manual QA checklist for what automation cannot cover — system integrations, wall-clock behavior, both locales — plus an issue registry.

## 1.1.0

- Honest skips (engine v2.1.1): a skipped exercise no longer inherits the session rating — its level and streak are left untouched.
- Hold timer for static exercises, with a 3-2-1 countdown; an early stop records the actual.
- Warm-up block; the screen no longer sleeps mid-workout.
- Settings: rest days, sounds and haptics, a reminder on training days.
- Local reminders, backup export/import, and a `levelsAfter` snapshot stored with each record.

## 1.0.1

- Privacy page restyled to match the landing page.

## 1.0.0

First release. Engine v2.1 (levels 0–31, 4 tiers, pull in every session), seven screens, local persistence.
